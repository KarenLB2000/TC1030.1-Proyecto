# OOP_Video_Game_Platform - Project

## Objective
The objective of the project is to develop a platform or virtual store focused on the sale of digital video games. Two types of users are considered: administrators and clients. Depending on the type of user, different methods or behaviors will be available.

## Functionality
The platform provides a variety of video games, allowing users to view their key features and search for specific titles. Clients can purchase video games and add them to their library, while administrators can perform system management functions, including modifying game prices.

## Implementation
The project is structured to include functionalities such as search, purchase, and management. Separate interfaces are provided for clients and administrators to access their respective functionalities.

## How to Run
To compile the program, access the console and enter: "g++ main.cpp"
To execute, enter in the console: "a.exe" or "./a.exe"

## Considerations
- The program may not behave as expected if:
  - A data type different from the expected is entered.
  - An invalid option is entered in the client or administrator menu.

## Corrections
For this last update, the following changes were made:
- Modifications were made to the Platform Class Diagram.
- The main was developed to check both administrator and client methods separately.
